    The nil plugin is useful in two contexts:

    First, it can be used for parts that identify no source, and can
    be defined purely by using built-in part properties such as
    ``stage-packages``.

    The second use is for parts that do define a source (which will be
    fetched), but for which the build step then needs to be explicitly
    defined using ``override-build``; otherwise, even though the source
    is fetched, nothing will end up in that part's install directory. In
    short, for the case of a part that uses the nil plugin and defines a
    source, it is up to the developer to then define the ``override-build``
    step that, in some way, populates the ``$CRAFT_PART_INSTALL`` directory.
