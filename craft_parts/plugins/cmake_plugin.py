    """The cmake plugin is useful for building cmake based parts.

    These are projects that have a CMakeLists.txt that drives the build.
    The plugin requires a CMakeLists.txt in the root of the source tree.

    This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for "sources".
    For more information check the 'plugins' topic for the former and the
    'sources' topic for the latter.

    This implementation follows the syntax and behavior used in the
    Snapcraft cmake plugin for core20. Unlike the cmake plugin used for
    core18, ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` is not automatically set. To retain
    compatibility with the Snapcraft core18 plugin, define the cmake
    parameter ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`` in your project.  This also
    allows libraries built using the cmake plugin and staged by a different
    part to be automatically recognized without defining additional
    parameters such as ``CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH`` or ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PATH``.

    This plugin uses the following plugin-specific keywords:

        - cmake-parameters
          (list of strings)
          parameters to pass to the build using the common cmake semantics.

        - cmake-generator
          (string; default: "Unix Makefiles")
          Determine what native build system is to be used.
          Can be either `Ninja` or `Unix Makefiles` (default).
