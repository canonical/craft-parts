    The plugin needs the ``scons`` tool which can be provisioned in one of the
    following ways:

    - Add "scons" to the part's ``build-packages``;
    - Build a custom version of ``scons`` on a separate part called ``scons-deps``
      and have the part that uses this plugin depend on the ``scons-deps`` part.

    Note that other dependencies (C/C++ compiler, Java compiler, etc) must be
    declared via ``build-packages`` or otherwise provisioned.

    Since there is no "official" way of defining the target installation directory
    for SCons-built artifacts, the default build will set the DESTDIR environment
    variable which contains the root which the SConstruct file should use to
    configure its ``Install()`` builder target.

    The plugin supports the following keywords:

    - ``scons-parameters``
      (list of strings)
      Additional values to pass to the ``scons`` and ``scons install`` command
      lines.
