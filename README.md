Craft Parts provides the *parts* mechanism for all Starcraft applications.

Parts provide a way to obtain data from many different sources, process it in various
ways, and prepare a filesystem subtree suitable for software packaging.

Parts can also be downloaded and built [directly from the command
line](https://canonical-craft-parts.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/how-to/cli_tool/) for
experimentation.

This library is most useful for app developers in the Starcraft family.

## Documentation

The [Craft Parts documentation][rtd-latest] provides guidance about
understanding and using the library.
