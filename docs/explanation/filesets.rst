Filesets
========

Filesets are named collections of files that are used to conveniently refer
to files in each step. Filesets are defined for all steps but are mostly used
in the *stage* and *prime* steps when files need to be collected and filtered
for deployment. See `Snapcraft filesets`_ for further details.
