Welcome to Craft Parts' documentation!
======================================

Craft Parts provides a mechanism to obtain data from different sources,
process it in various ways, and prepare a filesystem subtree suitable for
deployment. The components used in its project specification are called
*parts*, which can be independently downloaded, built and installed, and
also depend on each other in order to assemble the subtree containing the
final artifacts.
