Maven Plugin
============

Maven plugin is a plugin that simplifies building and packaging Jars for projects that use the
Maven (mvn) tooling. It is equivalent to running the following command:

.. code-block:: shell
    
    mvn package


Plugin parameter ``maven_parameters`` is used to additionally provide any arguments to the mvn
package command above. All values are passed in after the initial ``mvn package`` command
delimited by spaces.

Another plugin parameter ``maven_use_mvnw`` is used to leverage Maven wrapper files provided by the
project to run the package command. Initial mvn executable is replaced with projectâ€™s mvnw
executable file, resulting in ``./mvnw package`` command.

The plugin is able to detect and apply the following proxy environment variables
(case insensitive): ``http_proxy``, ``https_proxy``, ``no_proxy``. These environment variables can
be supplied through the ``build-environment`` directive. These environment variables will be used
to create a maven settings file (``.parts/.m2/settings.xml``) which will be supplied to the 
``mvn package`` command.

After the successful build, Java binary and Jar files will be installed in the
``CRAFT_PART_INSTALL`` directory. Java binary will be mapped under ``CRAFT_PART_INSTALL/bin/java``.
Jar files will be mapped under ``CRAFT_PART_INSTALL/jar/`` directory.
