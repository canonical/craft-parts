Go Use plugin
=============

The Go Use plugin allows for setting up a `go workspace`_ for `Go`_ modules. It is
a companion plugin meant to be used with the :ref:`Go plugin <craft_parts_go_plugin>`.
Use of this plugin sets up ``go.work`` and affects all parts.

Keywords
--------

There are no additional keywords to the the common :ref:`plugin <part-properties-plugin>`
and :ref:`sources <part-properties-sources>` keywords.

Dependencies
------------

The Go plugin needs the ``go`` executable to build Go programs but does not
provision it by itself, to allow flexibility in the choice of compiler version.

Common means of providing ``go`` are:

* The ``golang`` Ubuntu package, declared as a ``build-package``.
* The ``go`` snap, declared as a ``build-snap`` from the desired channel.

Another alternative is to define another part with the name ``go-deps``, and
declare that the part using the ``go`` plugin comes :ref:`after <after>` the
``go-deps`` part. In this case, the plugin will assume that this new part will
stage the ``go`` executable to be used in the build step. This can be useful,
for example, in cases where a specific, unreleased version of ``go`` is desired
but unavailable as a snap or an Ubuntu package.

.. _go-use-details-end:

How it works
------------

During the build step the plugin performs the following actions:

* Setup a `go workspace`_ if ``go.work`` has not been setup;
* Call ``go work use <source-dir>`` to add the source for the part to the workspace;

Examples
--------

The following snippet declares a parts named ``go-flags`` using the ``go-use`` plugin and
a ``hello`` part that declares this ``go-flags``` in its ``go.mod`` using the ``go`` plugin.
Correct ordering is achieved with the use of the ``after`` keyword in the ``hello`` part.
