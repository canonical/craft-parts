JLink plugin
=============

The `JLink <jlink_>`_ plugin can be used for Java projects where
you would want to deploy a Java runtime specific for your application
or install a minimal Java runtime.


Keywords
--------

This plugin uses the common :ref:`plugin <part-properties-plugin>` keywords as
well as those for :ref:`sources <part-properties-sources>`.

Additionally, this plugin provides the plugin-specific keywords defined in the
following sections.

jlink-jars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Type:** list of strings

List of paths to your application's JAR files. If not specified, the plugin
will find all JAR files in the staging area.

Dependencies
------------

The plugin expects OpenJDK to be available on the system and to contain
the ``jlink`` executable. OpenJDK can be defined as a
``build-package`` in the part using ``jlink`` plugin.
Another alternative is to define another part with the name
``jlink-deps``, and declare that the part using the
``jlink`` plugin comes :ref:`after <after>` the ``jlink-deps`` part.

If the system has multiple OpenJDK installations available, one
must be selected by setting the ``JAVA_HOME`` environment variable.

.. code-block:: yaml

    parts:
      runtime:
        plugin: jlink
        build-packages:
          - openjdk-21-jdk
        build-environment:
          - JAVA_HOME: /usr/jvm/java-21-openjdk-${CRAFT_ARCH_BUILD_FOR}


The user is expected to stage OpenJDK dependencies either by installing
an appropriate OpenJDK slice:

.. code-block:: yaml

    parts:
      runtime:
        plugin: jlink
        build-packages:
          - openjdk-21-jdk
        after:
          - deps

        deps:
          plugin: nil
          stage-packages:
            - openjdk-21-jre-headless_security
          stage:
            - -usr/lib/jvm

Or, by installing the dependencies directly:

.. code-block:: yaml

    parts:
      runtime:
        plugin: jlink
        build-packages:
          - openjdk-21-jdk
        after:
          - deps

      deps:
        plugin: nil
        stage-packages:
          - libc6_libs
          - libgcc-s1_libs
          - libstdc++6_libs
          - zlib1g_libs
          - libnss3_libs


How it works
------------

During the build step, the plugin performs the following actions:

* Finds all JAR files in the staging area or selects jars specified in
  ``jlink-jars``.
* Unpacks JAR files to the temporary location and concatenates all embedded jars
  into `jdeps <jdeps_>`_ classpath.
* Runs `jdeps <jdeps_>`_ to discover Java modules required for the staged jars.
* Runs `jlink <jlink_>`_ to create a runtime image from the build JDK.
